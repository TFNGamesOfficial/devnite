With the new Disover UI it will be possibe to display Creator made islands ingame without having a Deimos ID (also known as **Playlist ID**).

As already announced on Discord, the new Discover user interface will include a new color and more information about the modes (tags and a description). The UI will also include new tabs:

1. Discover (you will see this as soon as you change your mode)
2. My Library (your own playlists, favorites and last played games)
3. Browse (Finds games sorted by tags or searches them directly by name)
4. Island code (Enter the 9-digit island code to find the island)
5. Report (Reports islands that violate the [Creator Guidelines](https://google.com/))

The old UI will be replaced with the v1.3 update. After this update, the old UI is no longer available!
