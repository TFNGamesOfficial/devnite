**by StarGames**


The following changes are made with the v1.10 update:

## DAILY REWARD UPDATE
The login reward system has been improved and now gives 50 extra D-Coins (e.g. instead of 100 there are now 150 D-Coins). In addition, for all D-Coins that you have already received, the 50 extra coins will also be received. Here is an explanation:

You have received 100 D-Coins 5 times in the past. This will give you 250 extra D-Coins. Even if you got D-Coins 1000 times, you would get 50 D-Coins 1000 times

## MISSION REWARDS
The missions have also been updated! You now get 5% more rewards (excluding Battle Tickets and D-Coins). **However, the mission requirements have been doubled (so save 6 lives instead of 3).** You can find some of the updated missions [here](#NEW-MISSION-REQUIREMENTS).

## STORE REMOVED
We removed the store and replaced it with the Item Shop. However, this shop is different from the Battle Royale Item Shop!

# NEW MISSION REQUIREMENTS
Here are the new tasks/mission requirements:

- Save 3 lives -> Save 6 lives
- Build 6 Bases in Mystery Zones -> Build 12 Bases in Mystery Zones
- Survive 300 Hordes -> Survive 600 Hordes
