It's spooky outside. Monsters and aliens are running everywhere, trying to eliminate you.

<hr>
## **ALIEN VS MONSTER**
The new Limited Time Mode brings monsters to the island somehow. In the "Aliens vs Monsters" mode, two teams battle for victory. The team that reaches the designated elimination count first wins the game. Respawn is **enabled** but will be deactivated during the match. Parachutes can always be used, and you don't lose loot when you get eliminated, **but** you lose a rarity level.

## **RANK SYSTEM**
With today's update, ranks are being introduced.

**What is the rank system?**

The rank system puts you in a match with players of similar rank. Additionally, ranks will give you access to tournaments as the rank update replaces the Arena system.

## **OTHER CHANGES**

### UI UPDATE
In today's update, the user interface has also been refreshed. It now has a more modern design and is no longer simplistic.
<hr>
### RARITY UPDATE
We have added 2 new rarities to the game:
- Access Card
As the name suggests, this rarity is used for key cards.
- Tech
This rarity is for the tech from the Alien vs Monster mode.
<hr>
### STORM ADJUSTMENTS
We have made adjustments to the storm as it closed faster than planned in the last 4 phases.
<hr>
### SHOP UPDATE
The item shop has a new design, and we have removed the Shop tab. D-Coins can now be purchased in the item shop.

## BUG FIXES
- Fixed an issue that caused players to get stuck in the landscape.
- Fixed a bug where descriptions were not loading in the game mode selection.
- Fixed two UI bugs in the item shop.
